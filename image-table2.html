The American crocodile can be seen throughout the lowlands of Costa Rica, gliding along rivers or sunning on muddy banks. It has a long, strong tail, a scaly suit of armor and a very powerful set of jaws. The American crocodile's eyes, ears and nostrils are located on the top of its head, giving the croc a low profile while swimming through the water.

Thanks to their short legs, American crocodiles generally crawl along on their bellies, however, they are capable of "galloping" at a surprisingly fast pace. In the water, they often use their bodies and tails to swim rapidly in short bursts when necessary. 

An adult male American crocodile averages 13 feet in length and weighs approximately 400 pounds; his female counterpart is about 10 feet long and weighs only 160 pounds. The species can live up to 70 years, and is partial to warm, brackish waters - its habitat consists of river mouths, salt lakes, brackish rivers, estuaries and even the ocean. American crocodiles are most often found between southern Florida and Peru, with a high concentration in Costa Rica.

</strong></a><p>Deforestation eliminated most of the world's tropical montane cloud forests years ago and continues today. Unfortunately even areas like Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve  which are protected from logging are threatened as rising world temperatures move the elevation where the clouds first form higher and higher.
 
Scientists have found that plants and animals from lower climactic associations have been encroaching on the reserve and other Costa Rican cloud forest areas for decades.
The lowland rainforests are creeping up the hills and the cloudforests are being pushed off the mountaintops. Visit while you still can.



Sloth doing what sloths do best!</p></td>

<td valign="top"><a style="color:gold" href="https://forum.bc.edu/adit1340/images/sloth.jpg"target="new"><strong>There are two species of sloths: </strong></a><p>two-toed and three-toed. Although the name is misleading given that all sloths have three toes. Actually the species name refers to the number of fingers. But two-toed sounds way better than two-finger! So let's not duel on that. Their main physical differentiation, apart from the fingers, is their coloration (At least for the two species of sloths in Costa Rica). 

Three-toed sloths tend to be a grey color, with a white face mask that makes them look smiley all the time. Two toed sloths tend to be more beige to brown and lack the face mask but still offer a great smile. Three-toed sloths also possess an extra cervical allowing them to turn their head 270 degrees! Also three-toed sloths are diurnal while two-toed are nocturnal.</p>
