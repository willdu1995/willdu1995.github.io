New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman is 33 years old and has been battling through a painful chest injury for five games. Through it all, Edelman is on pace for his best statistical season and is far and away the Patriots’ best offensive skill-position player. Edelman caught eight passes on 11 targets for 78 yards with two touchdowns in the Patriots’ Week 8 win over the Cleveland Browns. He has 53 catches for 574 yards with four touchdowns now on the season. Through some simple multiplication, we can deduce Edelman is on pace for 106 catches for 1,100 yards with eight touchdowns by seasons end. Edelman’s career highs are 105 catches, 1,100 yards and seven touchdowns. Undersized “slot” receivers are supposed to slow down at this point in their careers. Edelman is still playing his best football. </p>
